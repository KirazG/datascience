## Capstone Project Two Proposal
# The IPL Match Predictor
### 1.	What is the problem you want to solve?

I am trying to solve three problems 
#### Predict the outcome
To predict the result of a t-20 IPL match based on various parameters such Home advantage, First Bat, Ground conditions, Toss, Team combinations. 
#### To assist the coach & captain in team selection 
Who should be included on each grounds against each opposition. Who is probably going to perform better. 
#### Fantasy League Prediction
What should be the composition of your fantasy league team. Fantasy league team is a visual game played by the cricket fans. In a day, the fans are allowed to pick their playing 11 from the four teams who plays on a day. 

### 2.	Who is your client and why do they care about this problem? In other words, what will your client DO or DECIDE based on your analysis that they wouldn’t have otherwise?
Each of the IPL team. I will publish my findings to the team's twitter handle and social forums. Based on the rate of success, the team can try to adapt to the findings.

### 3.	What data are you going to use for this? How will you acquire this data?
There is no ready made data available for this. I will be scraping old IPL data, current player's last 20 match data and also the ground conditions. These data will be finally arranged into multiple datasets as per the team and player statistics.  

### 4.	In brief, outline your approach to solving this problem (knowing that this might change later).
For predicting the outcome of a match, I will try to use Naïve Bayes, logistic regression, random forests and gradient boosted trees. For the second problem to assist in team selection, I will be gather individual player records to determing the best team for a particular match. Also use some of the set matching algorithms to decide the batting order. 

I will also refer to some of the research papers given below

#### Auto play : A Data mining approach to ODI cricket simulation and prediction

##### Using Machine Learning to Predict the Outcome of English County twenty over Cricket Matches

### 5.	What are your deliverables? Typically, this would include code, along with a paper and/or a slide deck.
I will be submitting the following as part of my final project
- Code in python Notebook
- Data Dictionary
- A blog
- A slide Deck
